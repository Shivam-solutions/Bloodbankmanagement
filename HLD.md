# High-Level Design (HLD) for Blood Bank Management System

## Introduction
The Blood Bank Management System is designed to manage blood donations, inventory, and transfusions efficiently. This document provides an overview of its architecture and key components.

## Architecture Overview

### Components

1. **User Management**
   - Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
   - Technologies: Django, SQLite

2. **Donation Management**
   - Manages blood donation appointments and records.
   - Technologies: Django, SQLite

3. **Inventory Management**
   - Tracks blood units in the inventory.
   - Technologies: Django, SQLite

4. **Transfusion Management**
   - Manages blood transfusion requests and records.
   - Technologies: Django, SQLite

5. **Notifications**
   - Sends notifications to users about appointments and inventory updates.
   - Technologies: Celery, Email, SMS (if integrated)

### Communication Between Components
